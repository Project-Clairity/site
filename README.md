# Project Clairity

#### A project focused on improving air quality in the Houston area. We address rising pollution concerns by researching local sources, forecasting air conditions, and promoting healthier living through awareness sessions. We also plant trees to naturally improve air quality for the community. Our goal is to build a cleaner, healthier future for Pearland and beyond. Join us in protecting the air we all share.
