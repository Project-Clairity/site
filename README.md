# Project Clairity

#### A project focused on improving air quality in the Pearland area. We address rising pollution concerns by researching local sources, providing current information about air conditions, and promoting healthier living through awareness sessions. We also plant trees to improve air quality for the community. Our goal is to build a cleaner, healthier future for Pearland and beyond.
